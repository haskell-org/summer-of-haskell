# Contact

The Summer of Haskell is organised by the
[Haskell.org Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell.org_committee).  You
can reach us by sending an email to `committee [AT] haskell.org`.
Alternatively, you can contact `m [AT] jaspervdj.be` directly.

There is also an IRC channel called `#haskell` on
[libera](https://https://libera.chat//) where you can ask for help.
