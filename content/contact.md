# Contact

The Summer of Haskell is organised by the
[Haskell.org Committee](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell.org_committee).  You
can reach us by sending an email to `committee [AT] haskell.org`.
Alternatively, you can contact `nvazou [AT] cs.umd.edu` and `m [AT]
jaspervdj.be` directly.

There is also a relatively active IRC channel called `#haskell-gsoc` on
[freenode](https://freenode.net/) where you can ask for help.
