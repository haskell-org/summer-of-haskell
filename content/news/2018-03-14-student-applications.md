Hey all,

As we've previously announced through different channels, Haskell.org was
accepted into [Google Summer of Code] 2018.

[Google Summer of Code]: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5706672807346176/

Students application have now opened.  Students can submit their proposal at the
[Summer of Code Dashboard](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).  The deadline
for submissions is the **27th of March**.

We are also seeking mentors for possible projects.  This year, we would like to
assign a back-up mentor for each student.  If you are interested in mentoring,
please [contact us](/contact.html) so we can add you to the mentor list
directly.  Having good mentors is an important factor in making the students
feel welcome and guiding them to a succesful completion of their projects.

If you would like to apply but you don't know how to start your proposal, have a
look at our [ideas list](/ideas.html) and [this great
guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/).

Lastly, we recognize that inclusion is an important part of our mission to
promote Haskell. Therefore, we strongly encourage applications from people in
communities that are underrepresented in functional programming, including but
not limited to women; people of color; people in gender, sexual and romantic
minorities; people with disabilities; people residing in Asia, Africa, or Latin
America; and people who have never taken part in similar programs before.
