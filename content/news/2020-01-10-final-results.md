[Haskell.org] took part in [Google Summer of Code] again in 2019, and we
had some really successful projects!

Unfortunately; this summary is less successful -- I meant to contact the
students immediately after the summer, but that mail never went through and
I failed to follow up on it -- my apologies.

In either case, I still wanted to list the successful projects here for
posterirty.  I reached out to the students again and will be updating this
post with more information and quotes as they get back to me.
