[Google Summer of Code] will take place again in 2020!

[Haskell.org] has been able to take part in this program in the past two years,
and we'd like to keep this momentum up since it greatly benefits the community.

Google is not extremely open about what factors it considers for applications
from organizations, but they have stated multiple times that a well-organized
ideas list is crucial.  For that, we would like to count on all of you again.

If you are the maintainer or a user of a Haskell project, and you have an
improvement in mind which a student could work on during the summer, please
submit an idea here:

For context, Google Summer of Code is a program where Google sponsors students
to work on open-source projects during the summer.  Haskell.org has taken part
in this program in 2006-2015, and 2018-2019.  Many important improvements to
the ecosystem have been the direct or indirect result of Google Summer of Code
projects, and it has also connected new people with the existing community.

Projects should benefit as many people as possible â€“ e.g. an improvement to GHC
will benefit more people than an update to a specific library or tool, but both
are definitely valid.  New libraries and applications written in Haskell, rather
than improvements to existing ones, are also accepted.  Projects should be
concrete and small enough in scope such that they can be finished by a student
in three months.  Past experience has shown that keeping projects "small" is
almost always a good idea.
