Google Summer of Code will take place again in 2019, [for the 15th year of the
program](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/11/google-summer-of-code-15-years-strong.html)!
We are very proud that Haskell.Org has been able to take part every year except
for the initial year (2015) and 2016-2017, when we had to resort to running our
own program.

Last year, we were fortunate enough to join again, and we think the results
[greatly benefited the Haskell community](https://summer.haskell.org/news/2018-09-01-final-results.html).
We are hoping to do the same for 2019.  As far as we know, a really important
part of our application to GSoC is the list of ideas we provide.  For that, I
would like to count on all of you.

If you are the maintainer or the user of a Haskell project, and you have an
improvement in mind which a student could work on during the summer, please
submit an idea here:

For context, Google Summer of Code is a program where Google sponsors students
to work on open-source projects during the summer.  Haskell.org has taken part
in this program from 2006 until 2015, and again in 2018.  Many important
improvements to the ecosystem have been the direct or indirect result of Google
Summer of Code projects, and it has also connected new people with the existing
community.

Projects should benefit as many people as possible â€“ e.g. an improvement to GHC
will benefit more people than an update to a specific library or tool, but both
are definitely valid.  New libraries and applications written in Haskell, rather
than improvements to existing ones, are also accepted.  Projects should be
concrete and small enough in scope such that they can be finished by a student
in three months.
