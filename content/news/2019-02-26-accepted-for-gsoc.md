title: 'Haskell.Org Participating in GSoC 2019'

We're very excited to announce that Haskell.Org has been
[accepted](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5556388114202624/)
into the [Google Summer of Code 2019 program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).
We hope that, like last year, it will lead to a whole range of improvements to
the Haskell ecosystem, and to new faces joining our community!

We would like to thank everyone who submitted ideas -- this is a key part of
being accepted into GSoC.  Now, here's the near term timeline:

- **Today - March 25**: Potential student participants discuss application ideas
  with mentors
- **March 25 - April 9**: Students can submit applications
- **May 6**: Accepted student proposals announced

At this point, we're looking for both students and extra mentors.  We would like
to assign at least two mentors to each project if possible, so the students get
the support they deserve.  Additional ideas for projects are still welcome!

There's a lot of information on our
[Summer of Haskell page](https://summer.haskell.org/).
If there are any students who are not sure where to begin, feel free to
[reach out to us directly](https://summer.haskell.org/contact.html)!
