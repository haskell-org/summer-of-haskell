# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by Haskell.Org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors. This program is open to all college students and newcomers
to open-source Haskell contributions, age 18 years or older, in most countries.
