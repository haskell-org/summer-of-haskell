# Introduction

The Summer of Haskell is an effort by Haskell.org to reach out to students and
encourage them to contribute to the Haskell community with the aid of
experienced mentors.  This program is open to college students, 18 or older, in
most countries.

In 2018, we are fortunate enough to have been selected in the [Google Summer of
Code] program, after missing out in 2016 and 2017.
