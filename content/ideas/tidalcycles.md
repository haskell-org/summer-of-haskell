title: Live coding algorithmic patterns with TidalCycles
---
[TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) (or Tidal for short) is a library for live pattern-making, usually musical patterns and often for an audience. It represents pattern using techniques based on Functional Reactive Programming, where both continuous and discrete events may be represented as a function of time. Tidal does not produce sound itself, and is co-developed with the SuperDirt framework for sound sampling and synthesis implemented in SuperCollider. It has a [thriving community](https://club.tidalcycles.org/) worldwide, tending towards musicians and artists without a formal background in computer science. A [recent streamed event](https://sun.tidalcycles.org/) featured 84 talks and performances. 

The [Tidal github repository](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/) has a range of active issues, among other possibilities. As the primary maintainer I'm particularly interested in supporting projects which make Tidal more accessible. Currently the main way to interact with Tidal is via an editor plugin as an intermediary with the ghci REPL. Developing an API approach could both support new UI approaches to Tidal, and could allow binary distributions drag-and-drop installers, rather than the current error-prone installation method which many beginners are turned away by.
