title: Expand json-autotype support to other functional programming languages
---

[json-autotype](http://github.com/mgajda/json-autotype) is currently the *most advanced* type and parser generator from JSON to Haskell. Using union types it works as most accurate type providers.

It was of general interest to enhance it to produce types and parsers for other strongly-typed programming languages like Elm, PureScript, Scala, Elixir, F#, or Java.
Beside practical importance, and will allow us to pitch Haskell as leading language to other strongly-typed language communities..
