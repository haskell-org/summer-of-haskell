title: Improve GHC Code Generator
---

Some simple improvement to the GHC's code generator can make a big
difference to performance. For example, a recent change reduced the
number of instructions to perform floating point abs from
approximately 20 to 2.

There are many open tickets for the code generator, at least two of
which are suitable for a GSoC student. For example

 * Adding SIMD support to x86/x86_64 NCG
 * Adding more SIMD primops corresponding to the untapped AVX etc. instructions

Steps for the student:

 * Review and curate the tickets related to the code generator
 * With the mentors, select those that are achievable in the timescale
   and that give the biggest bang for buck
 * Create PRs for one or more of the selected tickets
 * Update the guidance for working on the code generator (which may be
   out of date)
