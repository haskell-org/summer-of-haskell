title: Make Web scraping monad that is easier than state-of-art solution
---

Web scraping is of large practical importance for machine learning, search engines, and many other big data applications.

We already have Haxl monad for optimizing asynchronous data gathering from known sources, but our scraping capabilities in Haskell are much poorer than in other languages like Python ScraPy.

It would be great to implement special web-scraping monad, and equip it with many commonly used facilities, like authentication simulation, web front-end testing, and download acceleration.

(There are many more features, that I can enumerate to interested student.)
