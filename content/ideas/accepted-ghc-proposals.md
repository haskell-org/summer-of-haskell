title: Implement accepted GHC proposals
---

Proposed changes to GHC go through a rigorous discussion and review process
before they are accepted.  This happens in the [ghc-proposals] repository on
GitHub.

Once they are accepted, they usually still need to be implemented.  This is a
filter that shows the accepted but not yet implemented proposals:

<https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3AAccepted+-label%3AImplemented>

We think it should be possible for an advanced student to pick either one or
multiple (depending on the size) of these proposals and implement them over the
summer.

In this case a GSoC project proposal should clearly indicate what the work will
entail.  It is also strongly advised to contact prospective mentors about your
proposal.

**Potential Mentors**: Authors of proposals, GHC HQ

**Difficulty**: Advanced
