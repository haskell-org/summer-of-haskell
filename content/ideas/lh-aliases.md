title: Qualified aliases in Liquid Haskell
---

## Goals

Update the implementation of [Liquid Haskell][] to allow referring to
[type][] and [predicate][] aliases in qualified form.

[Liquid Haskell]: https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/
[type]: https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/specifications/#type-aliases
[predicate]: https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell/specifications/#predicate-aliases

## Background

Liquid Haskell is a verification tool for Haskell programs. The programmer
writes specifications for these programs, and Liquid Haskell checks if the
programs actually meet the specifications.

Recently, the Liquid Haskell implementation went through [a refactoring][] to
improve name resolution. Much of the names in the specification language can
be qualified now, in order to dissambiguate equal names that come from different
modules. There is an exception though, when it comes to type and predicate
aliases. For technical reasons, this constructs have been left behind in the refactoring.

[a refactoring]: https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/issues/2961

As the reference documentation explains, type aliases can be used to shorten specifications.
Instead of writing a spec like:

```Haskell
{-@ length :: [a] -> {v:Int | v >= 0} @-}
```

one can write

```Haskell
{-@ type INat = {v:Int | v >= 0} @-}
{-@ length :: [a] -> INat @-}
```

Unfortunately, if there are multiple `INat` aliases in scope, Liquid Haskell does not
allow to qualify the name to disambiguate. For instance, the following specification is
rejected with a message that says that `SomeImport.INat` is not in scope.

```Haskell
{-@ length :: [a] -> SomeImport.INat @-}
```

This project is to analyze the implementation and to design and implement a solution both
for type and predicate aliases.
There is a [corresponding issue][] in the Liquid Haskell repo.

[corresponding issue]: https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/liquidhaskell/issues/2481

## Outcomes

The main outcomes are a pull request with the implementation, tests, and code
documentation, and a discussion of the analysis and the design in the corresponding
issue.

A secondary outcome is a blogpost describing the experience and the results of
the project.

## Size

Project size should be near 175 hours. The project will require a fair amount of reading of existing
Haskell code, and building an understanding of how it works. Familiarity with the verification
mechanisms is not necessary a priori, though some user-level understanding of Liquid Haskell
is going to be needed to write tests.

## Required Skills

* Read and write technical English
* Haskell programming basics

## Project Mentor

* Facundo Dom√≠nguez, Tweag engineer and comaintainer of Liquid Haskell
