title: 'Algorithmic Pattern: formalising heritage algorithms for new creative interfaces'
---

Functional programming (and mathematics in general) is founded on the idea of _patterns_, which have a very long cultural history, including in crafts (braiding, wire-bending, tile patterns) as well as the performing and community arts (konnakol, bell ringing, maypole dancing, juggling siteswaps etc).

That patterns run throughout technology and the arts and crafts allows us to approach well-established cultural practices, many of which are 1000s of years old, and investigate the computational basis for their patterns, and also the 'user interfaces' that humans have developed to work with them.

A project idea for the Summer of Haskell then could make use of Haskell's advanced type system for formalising the structures underlying such an arts or crafts practice. Once formalised, this could be developed into creative user interfaces for making new patterns.

 Such a project would not necessarily require Haskell programming skills, as long as the mentee is happy to develop such skills during the project. You should have _some_ experience with programming, but perhaps more important would be expertise in the artform or craft that is to be translated into/explored through code. One important outcome of the project would be to introduce the mentee to working collaboratively on free/open source projects at the intersection of art, culture and technology.
 
This work would connect with the [Algorithmic Pattern](https://thentrythis.org/projects/alpaca/) research project that I run. I'm also instigator/maintainer of the [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org) free/open source live coding system, which the project could potentially feed into, but this is not a requirement.
