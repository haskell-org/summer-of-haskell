<h1>GSoC 2022 Ideas</h1>

<p>
  This is a list of ideas for contributors who are considering to apply to
  Google Summer of Code 2022 for <em>Haskell.org</em>.
</p>

<h2>For project maintainers</h2>

<p>
  Are you working on a Haskell project and you could use the help of a
  contributor during the summer?  Consider adding it as an idea here!
  You can contribute ideas by sending a pull request to our
  <a href="https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell">github
  repository</a>
  (<a href="https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell/blob/ba41af89efe18a2383163e80156cc900e443e461/content/ideas/stylish-haskell-ghc-lib-parser.md">example from 2020</a>).
  If you just want to discuss a possible idea,

<p>
  What is a good idea?  <strong>Anything that improves the Haskell ecosystem is
  valid</strong>.  The GSoC rules state that it must involve writing code
  primarily (as opposed to docs).
</p>
<p>
  Projects should be <strong>concrete and small enough in scope</strong> such
  that they can be finished by the contributor.  Past experience has
  shown that keeping projects ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is almost always a good idea.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Important change for 2021/2022</strong>:
  In the past, GSoC projects were expected to take up the equivalent of full
  time employment for a student.  In 2021, this was reduced to
  half time positions: students were expected to work around 175 hours in a 10
  week period.  In 2022, contributors now have the choice between a larger
  (around 350 hours) or a smaller project.  Ideas should indicate in which
  category they fall.
</p>
<p>
  Projects should benefit as many people as possible ‚Äì e.g. an improvement to
  GHC will benefit more people than an update to a specific library or tool, but
  both are acceptable.  New libraries and applications written in Haskell,
  rather than improvements to existing ones, are also welcome.
</p>

<h2>For students/contributors</h2>

<p>
  Please be aware that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    This is not an all-inclusive list, so you can apply for projects not in
    this list and we will try our best to match you with a mentor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can apply for as many ideas as you want (but only one can be accepted).

  <li>
    Some general tips on writing a proposal are discussed
