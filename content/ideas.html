<h1>GSoC 2020 Ideas</h1>

<h2>For project maintainers</h2>

<p>
  This is a list of ideas for students who are considering to apply to
  Google Summer of Code 2021 for <em>Haskell.org</em>.
  You can contribute ideas by sending a pull request to our
  <a href="https://github.com/haskell-org/summer-of-haskell">github
  repository</a>.  If you just want to discuss a possible idea,
  <a href="/contact.html">please contact us</a>.
</p>

<p>
  What is a good idea?  <strong>Anything that improves the Haskell ecosystem is
  valid</strong>.  The GSoC rules state that it must involve writing code
  primarily (as opposed to docs).
</p>
<p>
  Projects should be <strong>concrete and small enough in scope</strong> such
  that they can be finished by a student in three months. Past experience has
  shown that keeping projects “small” is almost always a good idea.
</p>
<p>
  Projects should benefit as many people as possible – e.g. an improvement to
  GHC will benefit more people than an update to a specific library or tool, but
  both are acceptable.  New libraries and applications written in Haskell,
  rather than improvements to existing ones, are also welcome.

    You can apply for as many ideas as you want (but only one can be accepted).
